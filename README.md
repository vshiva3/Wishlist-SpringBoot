# Wishlist-SpringBoot
I have built this project by using HTML and CSS in front-end and spring boot in the backend development.
By using HTML and CSS I built 3 pages one is Home page, Add item page and View items page. These three are handled by each handler methods in spring boot application.
These handler methods will respond to client's request and responds with model and view. View is the html that user sees. Model is data that is combined with view and sent to client.
This applocation named wishlist that can help us create wishlist. The items we want to buy can be added to wishlist and can be viewed in view items page.
There is Post handler method that handles submissions from client side and carries the data from client side to server side. Then handler method adds data to a data structure and 
populates the model with submitted data from cliet then it will be shown in view items page.
